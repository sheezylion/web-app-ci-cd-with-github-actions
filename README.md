# GitHub Actions Workflow: Automating Code Checks & Deployment

To ensure code quality and seamless deployment, we set up a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- ✅ Checks JavaScript Syntax Errors – Uses ESLint to prevent bad code.

- ✅ Validates HTML – Ensures the structure is correct.

- ✅ Detects Broken Links & Missing Resources – Ensures all assets load properly.

- ✅ Automates Deployment to GitHub Pages – Deploys only if all checks pass.

## How the Workflow Works

- Triggers on push to **main** – The workflow runs whenever you update your code.

- Performs Code Quality Checks – JavaScript linting, HTML validation, and broken link tests.

- Deploys to GitHub Pages – If everything is correct, the site is published automatically.
